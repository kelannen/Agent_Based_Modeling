## Part 1

### ADM 1, Côte d'Ivoire

This is a combination of the spatial statistical description of Côte d'Ivoire adm1 and its accompanying geometric bar plot that describes the population.

### ADM 2, Côte d'Ivoire

This plot is the same as the one above except for adm 2 instead of adm 1.

### Geometric Bar Plot

This plot is a geometric bar plot for Côte d'Ivoire adm 1, the bars themselves are broken out for each adm1 into the various adm 2s.

### Côte d'Ivoire - Denguélé

Denguélé is the adm 1 that I will focus on within Côte d'Ivoire. Denguélé contains two adm2s: Folon and Kabadougou. The below plot shows both the spatial plot including a population heatmap and labels of adm 2 with the population density underneath and a barplot of populations of all the adm 2s in Denguélé and the percent of the total population that the particular adm 2 contains. I choose to focus on Denguélé, as the population wasn't too large for me to run on my computer and contained enough urban areas as you will see in part 2.

### Côte d'Ivoire 3D

This is the link to the mp4 file of the 3D population density model of Côte d'Ivoire adm 2.

## Part 2

### Folon Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

This plot show the spatial layout of Folon Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire along with the basic population layout. I decided to start with this adm 2 as it was the least populous adm 2 in Denguélé while still having enough people to describe human settlements and urban areas.

This plot is similar to the one above, the only difference is that this one is a real valued pixel image representing a function that describes the probability of the population density at each pixel throughout the entire space.

The contour lines denote thresholds for population densities, with brighter colors within representing higher densities. These are the different urban areas I detected in Folon. I decided the value of the contour line levels based on the population and densities of what was and was not included in an iterative process.

This plot is essentially the same as the above but is a different visual in case that it is easier to see clearly.

### Urbanized Areas throughout Folon Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

This is similar to the plot above however designations of population and density have been added to the depicted urban areas in the one above through the size and color of the dots in the middle of the urban area.

### Folon and Kabadougou Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

For this plot I added the other adm 2 in Denguélé so that this plot show urban areas with their associated population and density (through the size and color of dots in the middle of designated locations) in both Folon and Kabadougou. There are a handful of main large settlements and as you go farther out from those settlements there are more dispersed settlements with smaller populations.

## Part 3

### Roads and Urban Areas throughout Folon and Kabadougou Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

This is the transportation services across Denguélé along with the urban areas. As you can see the whole location is pretty well connected and the majority of the roads are actually main roads instead of side and service ones. This means that Denguélé can handle heavy traffic and a lot of movement to and from all of its different urban areas. What is also interesting to see is that while the larger setttlements are the center points for where main roads connect, smaller settlements follow those roads or other side roads.

### Roads, Healthsites, and Urban Areas Folon and Kabadougou Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

Unlike the transportation services that connect the majority of the urban areas, there are barely and healthsites across Denguélé according to the data that I have found. There were only two pharmacies, and both are hidden compared to the urban areas and roads across this plot. This means that if people who lived here needed medical attention they would have to rely on services in surrounding adm1's and adm2's.

### Zipf's Law

The graph illustrates the log of the population and the rank of urban areas around Denguélé. The data shows follows the general trend of Zipf's law with some deviation as instead of a more linear line we can see more of an arched, polynomial line. This means in general the settlement sizes are relative to one another and there are some clusterings in a few locations where the main roads in the transportation system also connect (reference the previous two plots to see this).

## Part 4

### Topography

Here is an image of the topographic map of Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire. The urban boundaries included were produced earlier. The water surrounds only part of Denguélé, the rest is connected to other adm1s in Côte d'Ivoire. While the settlements are pretty evenly scattered around most of the largest settlements are in the flatter locations. There are also several medium sized settlements in the higher locations.
