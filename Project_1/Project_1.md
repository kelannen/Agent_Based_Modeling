## Part 1

### ADM 1, Côte d'Ivoire

This is a combination of the spatial statistical description of Côte d'Ivoire adm1 and its accompanying geometric bar plot that describes the population.

### ADM 2, Côte d'Ivoire

This plot is the same as the one above except for adm 2 instead of adm 1.

### Geometric Bar Plot

This plot is a geometric bar plot for Côte d'Ivoire adm 1, the bars themselves are broken out for each adm1 into the various adm 2s.

### Côte d'Ivoire - Denguélé

Denguélé is the adm 1 that I will focus on within Côte d'Ivoire. Denguélé contains two adm2s: Folon and Kabadougou. The below plot shows both the spatial plot including a population heatmap and labels of adm 2 with the population density underneath and a barplot of populations of all the adm 2s in Denguélé and the percent of the total population that the particular adm 2 contains. I choose to focus on Denguélé, as the population wasn't too large for me to run on my computer and contained enough urban areas as you will see in part 2.

### Côte d'Ivoire 3D

This is the link to the mp4 file of the 3D population density model of Côte d'Ivoire adm 2.

## Part 2

### Folon Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

This plot show the spatial layout of Folon Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire along with the basic population layout. I decided to start with this adm 2 as it was the least populous adm 2 in Denguélé while still having enough people to describe human settlements and urban areas.

This plot is similar to the one above, the only difference is that this one is a real valued pixel image representing a function that describes the probability of the population density at each pixel throughout the entire space.

The contour lines denote thresholds for population densities, with brighter colors within representing higher densities. These are the different urban areas I detected in Folon. I decided the value of the contour line levels based on the population and densities of what was and was not included in an iterative process.

This plot is similar to the one above, but is a slightly different way of looking at it as it shows

### Urbanized Areas throughout Folon Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

This is similar to the plot above however designations of population and density have been added to the depicted urban areas in the one above through the size and color of the dots in the middle of the urban area.

### Folon and Kabadougou Denguélé, Côte d'Ivoire

For this plot I added the other adm 2 in Denguélé so that this plot show urban areas with their associated population and density (through the size and color of dots in the middle of designated locations) in both Folon and Kabadougou.

### Zipf's Law

The graph illustrates the log of the population and the rank of urban areas around Denguélé. The data shows follows the general trend of Zipf's law with some deviation as instead of a more linear line we can see more of an arched, polynomial line.

Plot of the de facto settlement boundaries with geometric measures of population and density for all locations. Include linear descriptions of all transportation facilities. Also, include a description and analysis of the system of settlements that populate your selected location.
Provide an analysis of the system of settlements sizes and relative location to one another.
Provide an analysis of the transportation network and its capacity to facilitate access across your selected area.
