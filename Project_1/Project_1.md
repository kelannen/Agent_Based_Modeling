## Part 1

### ADM 1, Côte d'Ivoire

This is a combination of the spatial statistical description of Côte d'Ivoire adm1 and its accompanying geometric bar plot that describes the population.

### ADM 2, Côte d'Ivoire

This plot is the same as the one above except for adm 2 instead of adm 1.

### Geometric Bar Plot

This plot is a geometric bar plot for Côte d'Ivoire adm 1, the bars themselves are broken out for each adm1 into the various adm 2s.

### Côte d'Ivoire - Denguélé

Denguélé is the adm 1 that I will focus on within Côte d'Ivoire. Denguélé contains two adm2s: Folon and Kabadougou. The below plot shows both the spatial plot including a population heatmap and labels of adm 2 with the population density underneath and a barplot of populations of all the adm 2s in Denguélé and the percent of the total population that the particular adm 2 contains. I choose to focus on Denguélé, as the population wasn't too large for me to run on my computer and contained enough urban areas as you will see in part 2.

Plot of the de facto settlement boundaries with geometric measures of population and density for all locations. Include linear descriptions of all transportation facilities. Also, include a description and analysis of the system of settlements that populate your selected location.
Provide an analysis of the system of settlements sizes and relative location to one another.
Provide an analysis of the transportation network and its capacity to facilitate access across your selected area.
