There is a lot of information that is contained within images that is hard to extract, either because people don’t know how to use it or because it is computationally expensive. While more and more people are figuring out ways to use data in images, one of the most important tasks is detecting objects within the image which means finding the exact locations of objects in the image. One way to find object and localize it is through bounding box localization. 

Bounding box localization is based of the efficient sub-window search (ESS) algorithm. This algorithm avoids searching all window locations in an image by using branch and bound technique. The bound and brand technique considers all possible windows to find the window with the maximum score and minimizes classifier evaluations. ESS has been merged with another algorithm that improves how it handles cases where there are multiple objects. This image uses super pixelization and then the resulting super pixels to find multiple objects. Super pixelization is a preprocessing stage that only has to be done once for an image and then can be used multiple times. Another benefit of super pixelization is that the image super pixels themselves can help identify potential sub-windows (boxes). The claim that “given image's super pixels, sub-window's corner pixels could be moved toward the other pixels inside their super pixels and the updated sub-window still contains the object,” (Ibrahim et al. 108-119). Super pixel observations can be used to minimize the number of sub-windows that need to be evaluated and find comparable object detections.   

The R package boundingbox version 1.0.1 was published on 06/09/2020 by David Stomski. This package is similar conceptually to the algorithms discussed in the paper above. Bounding box “creates a bounding box in an image by generating ground truth cases for object localization algorithms. Cycles through a list of images, select points around which to generate bounding boxes and assign classifiers. Output the coordinates, and images annotated with boxes and labels.” For more details about how to use this package a good example can be found here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/introducing-boundingbox-package/#:~:text=It%20allows%20you%20to%20stream,images%20to%20be%20the%20same.

The algorithms and packages mentioned above allows people to effectively and efficiently find objects and multiple instances of objects within images, overcoming some of the difficulties of using that medium of data and the computational cost of doing it in real time. There are many applications to having this capability. One of the first ones is getting closer to being able to use something with massive quantities of images as well as numerous subjects within those images in models. This could be satellite images where you are looking a large image but only small amounts are important or there could be numerous subjects within that data. Similar in concept is using it for images that are monitoring human movements and being able to separate out each individual person. An example use case based off of a real project, is if someone wanted to have drones that scanned the ground for words or symbols that designated resources or types of aid that location/household needed after a natural disaster. The bounding box could be used to speed up the time it takes to identify where in that image the symbols are and if there are more than one. Relief after a natural disaster needs to be done quickly and in real time with minimal errors about missing any important information about what aid is required.
